# Vet-clinic Database

> In this project I used a relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic. I created a table to store animals' Information, Inserted some data into it, and queried it.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that are used to create a vet-clinic database:

- [schema.sql](./schema.sql) contains the creation of all tables.
- [data.sql](./data.sql) is used to populate tables with sample data.
- [queries.sql](./queries.sql) contains all queries for this database.
